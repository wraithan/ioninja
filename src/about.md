Wraithan is a software developer who likes to pick up newer technologies. At
last update he works at [New Relic](http://newrelic.com) on the [Node
Agent](https://npmjs.org/packages/newrelic). He greatly enjoys AI competitions
such as [AI Challenge](http://aichallenge.org/) and [The AI
Games](http://theaigames.com).

He's lately picked up a strong love of [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) which
was the inspiration for the blog's name. I'm hoping to fill this blog with
lessons I've learned while writing my projects in rust. Blog posts will have the
date they are published, and if there are any revisions, that will be clearly
marked with explaination at the bottom.

Wraithan it not seeking work, is not interested in recruiters and will not
forward on job opportunities to his colleges. That said if you want to get in
contact with him, email him at xwraithanx on google's mail service for personal
things. If it is work related hit him up at wraithan at newrelic.com.
